caching vision

key name:  key value => [LRU cache]
query on LRU cache:
look in cache
if size(cache) == count(DB)
  then done
else
  query DB
  add results to cache (expiring old if full)
  return union results
end

any unique property can be a key
any compound can be a key

query Lucene-type index for ids, then look up ids in cache

Lucene index can do ranges with exponential breakdown

something about a compound query *being* a key
